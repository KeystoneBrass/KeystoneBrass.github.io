# About Us
The Keystone Brass is comprised of friends from across the Keystone State who, associated at some level
through the Keystone Christian Education Association (KCEA), share a mutual enjoyment of playing brass.

[KCEA](https://kcea.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a fellowship of independent
churches and Christian schools following the historical and biblical faith, has been providing a vital
service to churches and Christian schools across the Keystone State since 1974, with a mission of
helping preserve freedoms and liberties in Pennsylvaniaâ€™s churches, schools, and families; promoting
quality in the education programs of our schools; and helping and encouraging those in need.
